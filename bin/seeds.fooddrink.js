    In memory of the old fishing shop, rods, wires, baits, nets, reels, floats, hooks and boats still bring life to the space, but this time in honor of another concept: a relaxed spot where you can taste great Portuguese canned fish.
    
    Here you can enjoy tasting Portuguese preserves, as well as the snacks that are created based on them. Besides the famous bluefin tuna, also known as the ham of tuna, there are various options: sardines, trout, eel, tuna, trout, mackerel, cod, as well as sardine roe.
    
    The wines are national and the canned fish is accompanied by Alentejo bread. If you don’t want to taste one of these preserves while relaxing in one of the colorful chairs, you can always buy some and take them home.
    
    The door is open to everyone, every day.`,

    Basílio, a playful and temperamental entrepreneur became one of the greatest coffee barons of the 19th century and when the coffee cycle grew, the independence of Basílio jumped out and he took a chance in his own farm. He challenged his cousin Nicolau and they prosper together with the export of coffee to all the European capitals. But the homesickness beat strongly and Basílio returned, has become a bohemian and “bon vivant” of Lisbon but always near his cousin.

    description: `Manteigaria is already a reference when it comes to making Pastéis de Nata (custard tarts). With five venues in total - three in Lisbon and two in Porto - Manteigaria is distinguished by the flavour that it gives to these traditional sweets and also by the experience it provides!

    Here, the Pastéis de Nata are absolutely delicious. We cannot say whether the secret lies in the selection of the best raw ingredients or the artisanal process, but we know that these are two of the main reasons why we recommend Manteigaria. The whole process is special, from beginning to end, and at Manteigaria, in Rua Augusta, you can monitor it! Upon entering the Portuguese building - where we used to find the iconic Camisaria Pitta - we can watch the whole cooking process. The factory is in plain sight, which makes visiting the store an even cooler experience!
    
    Since all the baking happens on the spot, there are always new batches of warm pastries. For this reason, when visiting Manteigaria you can taste pastries, fresh from the oven, creamy and crispy, and delight yourself while you enjoy the view over one of the most beautiful and busy streets in the capital.
    
    The truth is that regardless of how you prefer your Pastel de Nata - with sugar, cinnamon or plain - you will live a real Portuguese moment, which will make you want to stop time and enjoy it in the best possible way!
    
    Our suggestion for a delightful snack is to do like we have done: side your Pastéis de Nata with a cappuccino. Let yourself relax, after all, you are in Lisbon tasting the best the city has to offer.
    
    Cool Tip: Manteigaria in Rua Augusta is the third store opening in Lisbon. If you are in Chiado or Cais do Sodré, you can visit one of these places to get to know the cream and crispy Pastéis de Nata.`,
