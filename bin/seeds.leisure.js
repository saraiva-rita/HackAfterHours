    Nobody needs an excuses to have fun, but you gave you some arguments to take the bar for a walk:

    - You are visiting Lisbon and you would like to do something more radical then staying in line for Belém pastries
    - You want to have some drinks with you friends without having to stay on the same place.
    - You need to organize a office meeting outdoors before the “storm” damage’s the “brains”
    - You are looking for a hen or bachelor party with drinks and irreverence, running away from the usual strippers (our staff usually does not take off their clothes, unless it is too hot and nobody minds that they expose their greek gods' bodies)
    - Or simply because you are intelligent and know P-E-R-F-E-C-T-L-Y that life is to be lived with friends and some beauties of life must be appreciated all year, like the amazing sunset we can see from rio Tejo!`,
